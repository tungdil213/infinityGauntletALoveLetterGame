- Instructions

### Setup

1. Choose 1 player to be Thanos. The others are heroes players.

2. Give each player a reference card and return any extra reference cards to the bag.

3. Shuffle the 16 hero cards and place them as a facedown deck near the hero players. Each hero player draws 1 card from the deck as their starting hand.

4. Shuffle the 13 Thanos cards and place them as a facedown deck near Thanos. Thanos draws 2 cards from the deck as their starting hand.

5. Place the power tokens in a pile in everyone's reach.

6. Take the life-tracker card and place 1 slider on the top space of the hero track. Then place the other slider on the space of the Thanos track matching the player count (including Thanos).

    Place the life-tracker card in the middle of the table in everyone's view.

### Game Play

Players play cards representing heroes, villains, and the Infinity Stones to battle for the fate of the universe. There are 2 teams: Thanos is a team of 1, and all other players are on the other team.

The game ends when either team has no life left or when Thanos collects all 6 Infinity Stones and snaps.
